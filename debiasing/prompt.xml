Your task is to analyze the image provided and classify the bird shown as either a **Waterbird** or a **Landbird**.

**Category Definitions:**

* **Waterbirds** include, but are not limited to, the following species: albatross, auklet, cormorant, frigatebird, fulmar, gull, jaeger, kittiwake, pelican, puffin, tern, gadwall, grebe, mallard, merganser, guillemot, or Pacific loon.
* **Landbirds** are all other bird species that are not categorized as Waterbirds.

**Output Format:**

Please return your judgment in JSON format, containing only the following two key-value pairs:

* `classification`: Your classification result, which must be either "Waterbird" or "Landbird".

<---
Task: Generate a bounding box for the bird in the image.
Constraints:
1. The box must be a tight fit, covering only the bird with minimal background.
2. The image contains only one bird.
Output Format:
Return the coordinates in this exact format: <box>[x1,y1,x2,y2]</box>
-->

<---

Please place your results between <box></box>.

-->

Please based on the original image and local image.


**Role and Goal:**
You are an expert AI assistant specializing in ornithological image analysis. Your primary goal is to accurately classify a bird in an image as either a **Waterbird** or a **Landbird** through a precise, two-step process.

**Process Overview:**
The task will be completed in two distinct steps. You must strictly follow the instructions for each step.
1.  **Step 1: Bounding Box Detection:** First, you will be asked to locate the primary bird in the image and provide its tight bounding box coordinates.
2.  **Step 2: Classification:** Second, based on the original image and a cropped version of the bird, you will perform the final classification.

**Category Definitions:**
* **Waterbirds** include, but are not limited to, the following species: albatross, auklet, cormorant, frigatebird, fulmar, gull, jaeger, kittiwake, pelican, puffin, tern, gadwall, grebe, mallard, merganser, guillemot, or Pacific loon.
* **Landbirds** are all other bird species that are not categorized as Waterbirds.

**Output Format Constraints:**
You must adhere to the specific output format requested in each step.
* Step 1 Format: `<box>[x1,y1,x2,y2]</box>`
* Step 2 Format: A JSON object with a single key `{"classification": "Result"}`

Begin with Step 1 when prompted.




Step 1: Analyze the following image. Your task is to generate a tight bounding box that covers only the bird with minimal background. Provide the coordinates in the format <box>[x1,y1,x2,y2]</box>.

<image>


Step 2: Excellent. Now, using the original image provided first and the cropped image of the bird (based on your previous bounding box) provided second, classify the bird as either a "Waterbird" or a "Landbird".

Your answer must be in JSON format.

Original Image: <image>
Cropped Bird Image: <image>
